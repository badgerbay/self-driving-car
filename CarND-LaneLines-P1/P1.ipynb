    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "Weaknesses of my pipeline would be problems caused by:\n",
    "-Changes in the field of view: Obstructions such as other cars in the field of view\n",
    "-Changes in the linearity of lane lines: Extreme curved lines on turns\n",
    "-Changes in light conditions: Extreme low light at night\n",
    "-Changes in light reflection: Reflections and low contrast from water on road\n",

    "What I would like to add for the Advanced Lane Lines, to correct the curved line problem:\n",
    "In my Optional Challenge saved video, my right line jumps for a sec, due to curvature of line. \n",
    "For curving lines, color threshholding would help delineate the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "NEW REFLECTION: MY PIPELINE\n",
    "Using our 1st static test image, we display the image dimensions of 540 x 960 and 3 color channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRAYSCALE:\n",
    "One of the first things we do is convert the 3 channel RGB to 1 channel (grayscale).\n",
    "That will help the Canny transform, which looks at the gradient contrast. \n",
    "\n",
    "GAUSSIAN BLUR:\n",
    "We then apply the Gaussian blur, because the blurred average effect helps us to only focus on strongly contrasting boundaries (not noisy weak boundaries). The parameters are image and kernel size. Kernel size is the size of the region that is averaged.  I originally used a kernel size of 7, which is probably on the higher end of the best range, so I modified the value down to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "CANNY TRANSFORM:\n",
    "After we blur, we find the edges, using Canny. The parameters take the blurred gray scale image, and create a binary image determined by the strength of the pixels",
    "Between the low and high threshhold, the value is one. Otherwise, the value is 0. I used a low threshhold of 70 and a high threshhold of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROI:\n",
    "To identify the region of interest roi, we perform a crop of the edges image, we use imshape, to pull the height and width values of the image, and create 4 vertices: v1,v2,v3,v4. They values of the vertices are in percentages:\n",
    "def get_roi(w, h):\n",
    "    v1 = (int(w*.11),int(h)), \n",

    "    return([[v1,v2,v3,v4]])\n",
    "My calculated vertices are: (105, 540) (422, 324) (547, 324) (931, 540)\n",
    "\n",
    "HOUGH LINES TRANSFORM:\n",
    "Hough lines is doing the line calculations, and then calling the draw function.\n",
    "\n",

    "max_line_gap=20 (I do not want gap bigger than 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "In hough lines transform, we can transform a line to a point, and then transform that point back to a line: \n",
    "The problem with calculating y = mx + c is that m, or slope of a vertical line, is undefined, \n",
    "Every y has the same value of x. Delta y over delta x is undefined, because the x denominator is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of using the simple equation of a line, we us:  rho = x cos theta + y sin theta, where rho is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line, and theta is the angle formed by this perpendicular line and horizontal axis measured counterclockwise.  (Rho is rows, theta is columns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are identifying theta values that correspond to rho values, and we are saving those pairs.\n",
    "We find where there is the maximum amount of overlap in the lines, and that corresponds to a strong binary point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshhold is the number of votes required in our grid to count and even be considered a line.\n",
    "Min_line_length is obviously the minimum length of what is considered a line\n",
    "Max_line_gap is the maximum gap allowed between lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "WEIGHTED IMAGE:\n",
    "Weighted_img is to overlay the original image onto our lane line markers image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted_img has 5 arguments:\n",
    "lines: The lane lines from the Hough transform\n",
    "img: The original image\n",
    "alpha ?=0.8, if it is less than one, the lines image will be just a bit see-through (tranluscent)\n",
    "beta ?=1.0, it is one, so the original image is not transparent at all\n",
    "lambda ?=0.0, we set to zero, which means no diffusion.\n",
